# ODE forward and backwards in time comparison

How to run:
python ./tests/ode_forwards_backwards.py
![ODE forwards in time and backwards in time comparison when dt = 0.1](/tests/ode-comparison-small-dt.png)
![ODE forwards in time and backwards in time comparison when dt = 0.1](/tests/ode-comparison-large-dt.png)

In this case, backward ODE has smaller error then forward ODE.

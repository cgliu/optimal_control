# ODE forwards and backwards in time comparison

How to run:
python ./tests/ode_forwards_backwards.py --dt=0.1
![ODE forwards in time and backwards in time comparison when dt = 0.1](/tests/ode-comparison-small-dt.png)

python ./tests/ode_forwards_backwards.py --dt=0.1
![ODE forwards in time and backwards in time comparison when dt = 0.1](/tests/ode-comparison-large-dt.png)

In this example, backward solution gives smaller error than forward solution.
